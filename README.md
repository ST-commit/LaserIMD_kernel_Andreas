# LaserIMD_kernel

This repository contains the software for the calculation of a kernel for LaserIMD
that includes the effect of the non-secular terms of the zero-field splitting. 
The details of the inderlying theorie are presented in ...

The executable programm 'laserimd_kernel' for the calculation of S_{LaserIMD}^{non-sec}(t,r) as well 
as the python code to add a dipolar background and modulation depth can be found in the 
'exe'-folder. It also contains the kernels that were used in the mentioned manuscript.

The C++ source code for 'laserimd_kernel' can be found in the folder 'src'.
