To use the program laserimd_kernel.exe follow these steps:

1) 	Create a file PARAMETER_FILE.txt that contains the parameters
	that are necessary for the calculation of the kernel:
	-the zero-field populations Px, Py and Pz
	-the zero-field splitting values D and E
	-the Zeeman frequency of the triplet omega_T
	-the number of points of the dipolar grids. We recommend 200 points.
	-a file which containes the grid of the triplet label. It should be a comma separated 
	 .txt file with 4 columns. The first, second and third contain the values of the Euler angles
 	 alpha_T, beta_T and gamma_T and the fourth one contains the corresponding weights weights_T.
 	 We recommend the grid 'rep_3ang_12800pts.txt' in the 'example/grids' folder.
	-the lower and upper values x_0 and x_end and the number of points x_pts to specifiy the
	 x-values for which the Kernel shall be calculated. The x-values should fulffill the following
	 requirements:
	 For a kernel K(t,r) with the time-axis t and the distance axis r, 
	 x_end must be larger than t[end]/r[0]^-3. x_0 can be set to 0, if all data points of the LaserIMD
	 trace before the zero-time are removed. The number of x-points should be so high that the stepsize 
	 of x is smaller than (t[1]-t[0])/r[0]^-3.

2)	For the calculation of S_{LaserIMD}^{non-sec} use the program 'laserimd_kernel.exe' from
  	the command line and type in:
	"laserimd_kernel.exe PARAMETER_FILE.txt KERNEL_FILE"
 	The calculation may take a while. Once finished two .bin files will be created: 
	KERNEL_FILE_x.bin and KERNEL_FILE_y.bin.

3) 	For the generation of the final LaserIMD kernel K_{LaserIMD}^{non-sec}, the binary files need to be 
  	loaded with python with the function 'laserimd_kernel' in 'laserimd.py':
	K(t,r)=laserimd_kernel(t,r, KERNEL_FILE, lam=1, B=None) 
	In the folder 'examples', the script 'distance_analysis.py' gives an example how the thus generated
	kernel can be used to analyze LaserIMD data in combination with the Deerlab (version 0.13.2).
